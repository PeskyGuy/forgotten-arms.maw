                <p><em>A comprehensive guide to how chords work, written for enthusiasts and professionals alike.</em></p>
                
                <h3>What Exactly Is a Chord?</h3>
                <p>The term "chord" comes from the Old Tekk word "kord," meaning "core" or "heart." In spellarm terminology, a chord is a materialized iron projectile created through evocation magic and propelled by force.</p>
                
                <p>Unlike traditional firearms that require physical ammunition, spellarms create their projectiles on-demand from mana stored in batteries. This revolutionary approach eliminates the need to carry heavy ammunition while maintaining devastating kinetic impact.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Standard Materialized Chord Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weight: 3-5 grams of materialized iron</li>
                    <li>Composition: Pure iron with trace mithril (0.5%) for stability</li>
                    <li>Length: 15mm</li>
                    <li>Diameter: 9mm</li>
                    <li>Shape: Aerodynamic teardrop optimized for flight</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>The Physics of Chord Materialization and Firing</h3>
                <p>When you pull the trigger of a spellarm, a complex sequence occurs in milliseconds:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Step 1: Mana Draw</strong><br/>
                The trigger mechanism activates a mana siphon enchantment. This draws approximately 8 mana points from the mana battery (crystal) installed in the weapon. Most spellarms prioritize the battery over personal mana to ensure consistent performance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Step 2: Mana Channeling</strong><br/>
                The drawn mana flows into the focusing gem at the wand's tip. This gem contains a pre-programmed evocation matrix - essentially a spell that's been crystallized into permanent form.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Step 3: Chord Materialization</strong><br/>
                The evocation matrix uses approximately 5 mana points to materialize an iron chord directly in front of the focusing gem. The iron appears from raw mana, shaped by the matrix into the precise specifications needed. This happens in the materialization chamber just beyond the gem.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Step 4: Force Propulsion</strong><br/>
                The remaining 3 mana points are converted into pure kinetic force. This force launches the newly-materialized chord from 0 to 1,200+ feet per second in approximately 0.003 seconds. The wand barrel guides the chord, ensuring accuracy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Step 5: Discharge</strong><br/>
                The chord exits the barrel with tremendous kinetic energy. The focusing gem briefly glows (blue for standard models, other colors for elemental variants) and requires 0.1 seconds to cool before the next materialization cycle.</p>
                
                <h3>Why Iron? The Materialization Science</h3>
                <p>Glockius experimented with dozens of materials before settling on iron for materialization. Here's why it works:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Mana Efficiency:</strong> Iron has the lowest mana cost for materialization among dense metals. Creating 5 grams of iron requires only 5 mana points, while lead would require 8 and steel would require 7.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Density:</strong> Iron is dense enough to carry significant kinetic energy without requiring excessive mana to materialize. The balance between materialization cost and impact effectiveness is optimal.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Stability:</strong> Materialized iron maintains its form for approximately 30 seconds before dissipating back into ambient mana. This is more than enough time for the chord to reach its target and deliver kinetic energy.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Mithril Trace:</strong> The 0.5% mithril content serves a specific purpose - it stabilizes the materialized iron during the violent acceleration phase. Pure iron materializations would destabilize under the intense forces, affecting accuracy. Mithril reinforcement keeps the chord solid during flight.</p>
                
                <h3>Chord Variants and Materialization Matrices</h3>
                <p>While standard iron chords are most common, specialized materialization matrices can create different projectile types:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Elemental Chords</strong><br/>
                These require modified focusing gems with elemental attunement:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fire Chords:</strong> Ruby-attuned gem materializes iron infused with fire essence. Ignites on impact. Mana cost: 10 points. (Restricted)</li>
                    <li><strong>Ice Chords:</strong> Sapphire-attuned gem materializes iron infused with frost essence. Freezes target area. Mana cost: 10 points. (Restricted)</li>
                    <li><strong>Lightning Chords:</strong> Topaz-attuned gem materializes iron that discharges electricity on impact. Mana cost: 12 points. (Restricted)</li>
                </ul>
                Requires special permit and modified focusing gem (200+ gold pieces).
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Armor-Piercing Chords</strong><br/>
                Modified matrix materializes hardened steel with tungsten tip. Designed to penetrate magical barriers and heavy armor. Mana cost: 10 points. Military/Law enforcement only.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Training Chords</strong><br/>
                Simplified matrix materializes soft lead at reduced weight (1.5g). Lower velocity, less penetration. Mana cost: 4 points. Used for practice and certification tests.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Subsonic Chords</strong><br/>
                Matrix materializes heavier iron (7g) with flat nose. Travels below sound barrier for silent operation. Mana cost: 9 points. Popular with hunters and certain professionals.</p>
                
                <h3>The Focusing Gem: Heart of the System</h3>
                <p>The focusing gem is what makes a spellarm work. Without it, you just have an expensive wand that shoots metal.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Gem Types and Performance:</strong></p>

                - Lifespan: Potentially unlimited<br/>
                - Cost: Priceless (not commercially available)<br/>
                - Rumored to exist in prototype models</p>
                
                <h3>Mana Consumption and Battery Life</h3>
                <p>A common question: "How many shots can I fire?"</p>
                
                <p>The answer depends entirely on your mana battery:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Mana Batteries (Crystals):</strong><br/>
                All spellarms require a mana battery to function. These crystals store mana and feed it to the focusing gem:
                <ul>
                    <li>Minor battery: 160 mana (20 shots) - 10 gold</li>
                    <li>Standard battery: 400 mana (50 shots) - 25 gold</li>
                    <li>Greater battery: 800 mana (100 shots) - 50 gold</li>
                    <li>Superior battery: 1,600 mana (200 shots) - 100 gold</li>
                </ul>
                Each shot consumes 8 mana points (5 for materialization, 3 for propulsion).
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Personal Mana as Backup:</strong><br/>
                Some advanced models allow drawing from personal mana if the battery is depleted, but this is inefficient and draining:
                <ul>
                    <li>Untrained civilian: 30-50 mana (3-6 emergency shots)</li>
                    <li>Basic training: 50-100 mana (6-12 emergency shots)</li>
                    <li>Professional: 100-200 mana (12-25 emergency shots)</li>
                    <li>Combat mage: 200-500 mana (25-62 emergency shots)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Battery Recharging:</strong><br/>
                Unlike older single-use crystals, modern mana batteries can be recharged at any mana station for 1 copper per 10 mana points. Full recharge of a standard battery costs 40 copper (4 silver).</p>
                
                <h3>Maintenance and Care</h3>
                <p>Spellarms require less maintenance than traditional firearms, but they're not maintenance-free:</p>
                
                <p><strong>After Every Use:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wipe down the barrel with a clean cloth</li>
                    <li>Check the focusing gem for cracks or cloudiness</li>
                    <li>Inspect the materialization chamber for residue buildup</li>
                    <li>Check mana battery charge level</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Monthly:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deep clean the materialization chamber</li>
                    <li>Test mana draw efficiency (should be within 5% of baseline)</li>
                    <li>Inspect trigger mechanism for wear</li>
                    <li>Verify battery connection integrity</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Annually:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Professional inspection by certified artificer</li>
                    <li>Focusing gem evaluation (replace if efficiency drops below 70%)</li>
                    <li>Complete disassembly and cleaning</li>
                    <li>Enchantment refresh (if applicable)</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <h3>Common Problems and Solutions</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Weak shots or reduced range<br/>
                <strong>Cause:</strong> Degraded focusing gem or low mana<br/>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Replace gem or recharge mana source</p>
                
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Failure to materialize chords<br/>
                <strong>Cause:</strong> Depleted battery or corrupted materialization matrix<br/>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Recharge/replace battery or have matrix recalibrated by artificer</p>
                
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Overheating after few shots<br/>
                <strong>Cause:</strong> Cracked focusing gem or mana leak<br/>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Immediate professional inspection - DO NOT FIRE</p>
                
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Inaccurate shots<br/>
                <strong>Cause:</strong> Barrel misalignment or unstable materialization<br/>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Professional barrel alignment or focusing gem replacement</p>
                
                <h3>The Future of Chord Technology</h3>
                <p>Research continues into improved materialization techniques:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Self-Guiding Matrices:</strong> Experimental focusing gems that can adjust chord trajectory during materialization. The chord is "pre-curved" to compensate for target movement. Currently too complex for practical use.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Ambient Mana Draw:</strong> Matrices that supplement battery power by drawing from ambient environmental mana. Promising but unstable in low-mana environments.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Rapid Dissipation:</strong> Environmental concerns have led to research into chords that dissolve within seconds of impact rather than 30 seconds. This would reduce iron contamination in urban areas.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Multi-Projectile Materialization:</strong> Matrices that create multiple smaller chords per shot. Banned in most jurisdictions but technically fascinating - essentially a magical shotgun.</p>
