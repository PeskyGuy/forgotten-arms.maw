                <p><em>Understanding where we came from to appreciate where we are.</em></p>
                
                <h3>The Tekk Philosophy</h3>
                <p>During the Civil Centennial War (1835-1935 A.U.), the world was divided between two ideologies. The Magus faction believed magic was the ultimate power. The Tekk faction believed technology would triumph.</p>
                
                <p>The Tekks weren't wrong - they were just incomplete.</p>
                
                <p>Their philosophy was simple: "Any person, regardless of birth or talent, should be able to wield power." In a world where magic was hereditary and required years of training, this was revolutionary. A farmer's son could pick up a Tekk rifle and be as dangerous as a trained battle mage.</p>
                
                <h3>Evolution of Tekk Firearms</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Early Period (1835-1860 A.U.)</strong></p>
                <p>The first Tekk firearms were crude muskets - single-shot weapons that took 30 seconds to reload. But they worked. A line of Tekk infantry could deliver devastating volleys that even magical shields struggled to stop.</p>
                
                <p>Key innovations:
                <ul>
                    <li>Rifled barrels for improved accuracy</li>
                    <li>Percussion caps replacing flintlocks</li>
                    <li>Standardized ammunition</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>Middle Period (1860-1900 A.U.)</strong></p>
                <p>As the war intensified, so did the technology. Breech-loading rifles replaced muzzle-loaders. Metallic cartridges replaced paper and powder. Rate of fire increased from 3 rounds per minute to 15.</p>
                
                <p>The Model 1885 "Equalizer" rifle became legendary. It could fire 20 rounds per minute with accuracy out to 500 yards. Magus forces learned to respect Tekk marksmen.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Late Period (1900-1935 A.U.)</strong></p>
                <p>The final decades saw rapid advancement. Semi-automatic pistols, bolt-action rifles, and even early automatic weapons appeared. The Model 1920 "Liberator" could fire 30 rounds per minute with devastating effect.</p>
                
                <p>But the Tekks faced a fundamental problem: logistics. Each soldier needed to carry pounds of ammunition. Supply lines became critical vulnerabilities. The Magus forces, who could conjure attacks from personal mana, had a strategic advantage.</p>
                
                <h3>Key Tekk Innovations That Influenced Spellarms</h3>
                
                <p><strong>1. Magazine Feeding Systems</strong></p>
                <p>The Tekks developed detachable box magazines that could be quickly swapped. Glockius adopted this wholesale - spellarm magazines work almost identically, just holding chords instead of cartridges.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Trigger Mechanisms</strong></p>
                <p>Tekk trigger groups were marvels of mechanical engineering - reliable, safe, and intuitive. Modern spellarms use nearly identical trigger systems, just with added mana activation enchantments.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3. Sighting Systems</strong></p>
                <p>Iron sights, aperture sights, and early optical scopes all came from Tekk innovation. Spellarms use the same principles, sometimes enhanced with minor divination magic.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. Ergonomics</strong></p>
                <p>The Tekks spent decades perfecting weapon ergonomics - grip angles, weight distribution, balance points. Why reinvent the wheel? Glockius studied Tekk firearms extensively and borrowed their best features.</p>
                
                <p><strong>5. Standardization</strong></p>
                <p>The Tekks understood that interchangeable parts and standardized ammunition were crucial for military effectiveness. This philosophy carries through to modern spellarms - a standard chord works in any compatible weapon.</p>
                
                <h3>Famous Tekk Firearms</h3>
                
                <p><strong>Model 1885 "Equalizer" Rifle</strong></p>
                <p>The weapon that defined an era. Single-shot, bolt-action, .45 caliber. Accurate to 500 yards. Over 2 million produced. Many were captured and studied by Magus artificers, including Glockius.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Model 1900 "Liberator" Rifle</strong></p>
                <p>The pinnacle of Tekk rifle design. Bolt-action, 5-round internal magazine, .30 caliber. Could fire 30 aimed shots per minute. The weapon that nearly won the war for the Tekks.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Model 1915 "Defender" Pistol</strong></p>
                <p>Semi-automatic, 8-round magazine, .45 caliber. The first truly reliable Tekk pistol. Officers on both sides prized captured examples.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Model 1925 "Peacemaker" Automatic Rifle</strong></p>
                <p>The Tekks' answer to mage superiority. Fully automatic, 20-round magazine, .30 caliber. Could fire 600 rounds per minute. Devastating but ammunition-hungry.</p>
                
                <h3>The Tekk-Magus Technology Exchange</h3>
                <p>After The Union was founded in 1935 A.U., something remarkable happened. Tekk engineers and Magus artificers began working together. The knowledge exchange was explosive.</p>
                
                <p>Tekk engineers learned about mana manipulation, enchantment theory, and evocation matrices. Magus artificers learned about metallurgy, mechanical engineering, and mass production.</p>
                
                <p>Glockius was at the center of this exchange. He spent years interviewing Tekk gunsmiths, studying their designs, understanding their philosophy. His respect for their work was genuine.</p>
                
                <p>"The Tekks proved that power doesn't require magic," he wrote. "I'm just proving that magic can make that power better."</p>
                
                <h3>Preserved Tekk Firearms</h3>
                <p>Several museums maintain collections of Tekk firearms:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Vyrodin Museum of Magical History</strong><br/>
                Extensive collection including rare prototypes. Open daily.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Union Memorial Museum</strong><br/>
                Focuses on weapons from both sides of the Civil Centennial War. Includes interactive demonstrations.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Glockius Institute Archives</strong><br/>
                Contains Glockius's personal collection of Tekk firearms, including his annotated study pieces. Researchers only.</p>
                
                <h3>Modern Tekk Influence</h3>
                <p>Walk into any spellarm shop and you'll see Tekk influence everywhere:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>The grip angle of a Glockius G-17? Copied from the Model 1915 Defender.</li>
                    <li>The magazine release button? Tekk innovation from 1910 A.U.</li>
                    <li>The safety mechanisms? Based on Tekk designs.</li>
                    <li>Even the terminology - "trigger," "barrel," "magazine" - all Tekk words.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>A Note on Respect</h3>
                <p>It's easy to dismiss the Tekks as "the losing side" of the Civil Centennial War. But that's unfair and inaccurate. The war ended not because the Tekks lost, but because both sides realized they were stronger together.</p>
                
                <p>Every time you fire a spellarm, you're using Tekk engineering enhanced by Magus magic. That's not victory for one side - it's synthesis of both.</p>
                
                <p>Glockius understood this. His greatest achievement wasn't inventing spellarms. It was proving that the Tekk and Magus philosophies could coexist, could enhance each other, could create something neither could achieve alone.</p>
                
                <p>The Tekk legacy lives on in every spellarm. And that's something worth remembering.</p>
