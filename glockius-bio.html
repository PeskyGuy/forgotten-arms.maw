                <p><em>A comprehensive biography of the artificer who changed warfare forever.</em></p>
                
                <h3>Early Life (1858-1875 A.U.)</h3>
                <p>Born Glockius Ferrum in the industrial quarter of what would become Vyrodin on the 3rd of Harvest, 1858 A.U., the man who would become known simply as "Genius Glockius" showed remarkable aptitude from an early age. His father was a metalworker who supplied components to both Magus and Tekk forces during the Civil Centennial War - a dangerous position that required strict neutrality.</p>
                
                <p>Young Glockius spent his childhood in the forge, learning metallurgy and mechanical principles. But he also displayed natural magical talent, particularly in evocation. By age 12, he could conjure force bolts strong enough to dent steel plate. His mother, a hedge mage, recognized his gift and arranged for formal training at a Tekk engineering academy.</p>
                
                <h3>Education and Early Career (1875-1880 A.U.)</h3>
                <p>At the academy, Glockius was an unusual student. While his peers focused on traditional engineering, he obsessed over the intersection of magic and mechanics. His thesis, "Evocation Matrices in Industrial Applications," was initially rejected as "too practical" before a sympathetic professor pushed it through.</p>
                
                <p>After graduation in 1878 A.U., Glockius worked for several artificer shops, gaining a reputation for solving "impossible" problems. He developed improved mana crystals, self-repairing armor enchantments, and a revolutionary arcane furnace that could reach temperatures previously thought impossible.</p>
                
                <h3>The Partnership with Archmage Minoph (1880-1970 A.U.)</h3>
                <p>In 1880 A.U., Glockius received an unexpected summons. Archmage Aceta Minoph, a powerful Magus mage who would eventually become one of the Heroes of the Union, needed a personal artificer. The interview was brief:</p>
                
                <p><em>"Can you make the impossible possible?"</em> Minoph asked.<br/>
                <em>"Only on weekdays,"</em> Glockius replied. <em>"On weekends, I make the unthinkable routine."</em></p>
                
                <p>He was hired on the spot.</p>
                
                <p>Over the next ninety years, Glockius and Minoph collaborated on dozens of projects. They developed the arcane communication network that would evolve into the M.A.W., created self-sustaining barrier systems for city defense, and pioneered mana-efficient transportation methods.</p>
                
                <p>But their most famous collaboration was the spellarm.</p>
                
                <h3>The Spellarm Project (1882-1895 A.U.)</h3>
                <p>The project began during the middle of the Civil Centennial War. In 1882 A.U., Glockius was examining Tekk firearms used in the ongoing conflict, trying to understand their appeal. Despite working with a Magus mage, he appreciated the elegance of their design - the way they put devastating power in anyone's hands, regardless of magical ability.</p>
                
                <p>"Magic is powerful but exclusive," he wrote in his journal. "Firearms are democratic but limited. What if we could combine the best of both?"</p>
                
                <p>The first prototype took three years. The Mark I "Arcane Pistol" was crude - it overheated, required long charging times, and occasionally backfired. But it proved the concept: a weapon that used mana instead of gunpowder, that could be wielded by anyone with even basic magical training.</p>
                
                <p>Refinement took another decade. The breakthrough came in 1892 A.U. with the invention of chords - small iron projectiles materialized from mana and accelerated by evocation magic. This solved the power problem while keeping mana costs manageable.</p>
                
                <p>By 1895 A.U., spellarms entered mass production on both sides of the war. Glockius's design was so elegant that it became the industry standard. Even today, over a century later, most spellarms follow his basic principles. The invention revolutionized the final decades of the war, changing the nature of combat forever.</p>
                
                <h3>Later Years and Disappearance (1895-1970 A.U.)</h3>
                <p>After the war ended in 1935 A.U., Glockius continued working with Minoph on various projects, refining spellarm technology for peacetime use and developing the Mass Arcane Web. Despite being over 70 years old at the war's end, he showed no signs of slowing down. His longevity was attributed to constant exposure to mana and alchemical treatments he had developed over the decades.</p>
                
                <p>He became increasingly interested in the theoretical limits of mana manipulation and the nature of the M.A.W. itself. By the 1960s, at over 100 years old, he was still actively researching and inventing.</p>
                
                <p>In 1970 A.U., at the remarkable age of 112, Glockius disappeared along with Archmage Minoph and the other Heroes of the Union. The circumstances remain mysterious. Some say they embarked on a secret mission. Others believe they discovered something that required their permanent attention. The Church of Embrace maintains official silence on the matter.</p>
                
                <h3>Legacy</h3>
                <p>Glockius left behind more than just spellarms. His approach to magic - practical, efficient, accessible - influenced an entire generation of artificers. The Glockius Institute of Applied Arcana in Vyrodin continues his work, training artificers in his methods.</p>
                
                <p>His personal motto, inscribed above the Institute's entrance, summarizes his philosophy:</p>
                
                <p><strong>"Magic should serve people, not the other way around."</strong></p>
                
                <h3>Personal Life</h3>
                <p>Despite his fame, Glockius remained notoriously private. He never married, claiming his work was his family. Colleagues described him as intense but fair, demanding but supportive. He had a dry sense of humor and a habit of working through the night when inspiration struck.</p>
                
                <p>He was known to carry a prototype spellarm at all times - not for protection, but because "you never know when you'll think of an improvement." That weapon, the Mark VII "Personal Defense Model," is now displayed in the Vyrodin Museum of Magical History.</p>
